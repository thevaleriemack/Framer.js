# Framer.js

Created a crude animation on Framer of a level design solution for my team's game--Clone Combat.
The animation can be viewed here: http://share.framerjs.com/ppehr26uwgwj/
(Note the window size must be 640 by 480 to work properly.)
Clone Combat can be played on newgrounds here: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/666197
